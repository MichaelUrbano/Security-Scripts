# Security Scripts

These scripts are actively being worked on, if you would like to get the only one currently present in the repository:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelUrbano/Security-Scripts/refs/heads/main/Linux/linux-comp-harden-generic.sh`

If you want to change some of the variables within the script, create a `.env` file within your `$HOME` directory, currently, the only variable supported is:
`BAKDIR`: Will change the directory used for backups
